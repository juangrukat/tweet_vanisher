💡 Notes
	•	The script saves progress in your browser using localStorage. If it’s interrupted, you can re-run it and it will skip already-deleted tweets.
	•	If the script freezes or malfunctions, you can manually reload the page and run it again. This usually resolves issues with long scrolling sessions or stale DOM.
	•	You can press the Escape key at any time to stop the process and re-enable your browser normally.
